					<p><font size="3"><strong>The</strong></font> battle of Stalingrad was one of the most brutal battles of WWII.
					In 1939 Hitler and Stalin invade Poland and the two countries make a pact and split the country in two. Hitler was not a fan of communism and Stalin watches as Germany
					marches on to take the rest of Europe. As Stalin looked on it was clear Hitler didn't want to stop just taking the west and turned his eyes to the east.
					On the June 22nd 1942, Hitler attacks the Soviet Union, he wanted to defeat the Russians quickly and used Blitzkrieg tactics. The Red army suffer three million casualties.
					<br><br>The army had stopped at Moscow. Needing more oil and resources Hitler heads south to the rich oil fields. He spots a city called Stalingrad.
					To take this city would not only take the weapons factories but humiliate Stalin as he has the same name. The German army splits in two and heads towards Stalingrad on the river Volga.
					Stalin asks for every citizen to uphold the city against the German invasion. The citizens knew about the German atrocities of Poland and elsewhere and
					were determined to secure the city.<br><br>They created defenses and trenches in fear of the advancing army. They braced themselves for the ground attack. However the attack
					came from air. Swarms of bombers let thousands of tonnes bombs onto the city, fires didn't go out for months. By the end it the aerial attack the city was in ruins.
					The German artillery had not even arrived and the population of Stalingrad were trapped in the city. There were about one million women in the Russian army armed and ready for combat.
					When the Germans arrived they were surprised at this and knew they had to annihilate the whole population. The Russian army defended the city with guerrilla warfare.
					<br><br>The Germans were surprised by the Russian aggression but forced them back towards a small part of the city. Ninety percent of the city was now controlled by the Germans.
					Winter was coming in and the Germans were now running low on food and supplied. They still couldn't take the resistance. The Russians had now massed one million soldiers
					and headed towards Stalingrad at night. When they reached the city they surrounded the German troops. With supplies low and now three hundered thousand Germans surrounded with no food and supplies
					the Germans surrendered against Hitlers orders. Most of the Army died of starvation. After five months Stalingrad was no longer under German control it was a great victory for the Russians. (Netflix)</p>
