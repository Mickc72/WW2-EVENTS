					<p><font size="3"><strong>The </strong></font>D'Day landings was the largest invasion in history. With thousands of ships, aircraft and one hundred and sixty thousand troops, it was one of the most audacious events of WWII.
					In 1942 Hitler fortifiers the entire Atlantic coast from the Spanish borders to the Arctic countries. Churchill however, felt it was time to attack and wanted to take Dieppe,
					Thousands of Canadian and British troops were lost.<br><br>In the Pacific the Americans were beating the German army
					and the Russians in Stalingrad, for the first time the German army looked vulnerable. Stalin and Roosevelt put Pressure was on Churchill.
					The Prime Minister needed the Americans and requested more troops from the US. Operation overlord was given the green light.
					The Germans had intercepted allied radio confirming it would be Calais so Hitler had illions of mines and obstacles placed with extra fortification on the beaches.
					The allies produced gigantic floating ports and an underwater oil pipeline to refuel the giant armada.<br><br>Eisenhower and Montgomery were the commanders of the allies, and rested on the French tides and a calm sea
					for a successful attack. The RAF bombed the bridges and towns along the French coastal towns so there was nowhere for the Germans to hide.
					In Britain two million troops three thousand tanks and twelve thousand aircraft are primed for the invasion.
					On June 5th 1944 on the eve of D'Day, allies set sail but bad weather halts the invasion. Ships are stuck and men are sick. When the green light is given the allied troops are surprised they are
					on there way to Normandy not Calais, Hitler was played for a fool.<br><br>It was The German soldiers in Normandy that witnessed a sea of metal coming towards them not Calais as thought.
					Americans, British and Canadians stormed the beaches against a fierce opposition. While dummy paratroopers were landing at Calais the full force of operation overlord
					overtakes the German forces. After successfully overtaking the beaches the allies flood inland incountering Panzar tank divisions and many soilders. However, the Germans now running out supplies and food surrender after a long battle.
					When fighting was over, ten thousand German soldiers are killed and forty thousand are captured. The successful D'day landings marked the beginning of the end of the occupation of France and the war. (Netflix)</p>
