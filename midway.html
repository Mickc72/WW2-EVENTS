					<p><font size="3"><strong>Midway</strong></font>  island was the property of the US navy. After the humiliation attack on Pearl Harbour
					Admiral Nimitz, now the new commander of the pacific fleet has four effective aircraft carriers. The Americans bomb Tokyo and some bombs even landed in the Emperors garden.
					This enraged the Japanese and Admiral Yamomoto was ordered to finish the US Pacific fleet for good.
					His plan was to lure the ships out of the Harbour so they planned an attack the island of Midway.<br><br>When two of the US aircraft carriers fighting in Port Morsby
					return to the island the Japanese locate them and attack. Two of the Japanese carriers are damaged but the carrier Lexington is sunk and the Yorktown is heavily damaged, even before the Battle of midway has even begun.
					The attack on Midway triggers the rest of the US fleet to scramble towards the island and sails a thousand miles across the Pacific. The Japanese holds a reserve
					battleship fleet of ships for the surprise attack. When the Americans arrive at the island with two carriers they are met with surprise by the Japanese.
					A US code breaker believed there is a going to be an attack on the island and proved to the higher commanders he was correct. This turned the tables on the art of surprise for the Japanese.
					<br><br>The Americans had not only two but three carriers as the Yorktown returned to base damaged but repairable. The strike was launched. Most of the torpedoes failed to detonate. Only one man survives from the first torpedo squadron.
					Dive bombers were now sent off on the wrong direction they could not find the Japanese fleet and with no satellite GPS or satellite navigation they had to fly back to the US carriers. By now the four Japanese carriers
					were closing in on the Americans. At this time the Japanese were winning the war, however the lost American dive bomber squadron with luck now spotted a Japanese destroyer.
					Low on fuel the squadron leader risks following the lone destroyer with no carriers in sight. Ten minutes later a miracle happened.
					At 10,000 ft. The bombers find the whole Japanese fleet.<br><br>Incredibly a fleet of dive bombers from the USS Yorktown comes across the Japanese fleet at the same time.
					Now there are four squadrons to attack the fleet with no Japanese fighters in their way as they are fighting for Midway Island. The attack begins, the bombs are incredibly accurate.
					Within minutes the Battle of Midway has turned again. Four of the Imperial carriers are destroyed and Japanese planes are now forced tro ditch onto the Ocean.
					Three thousand men are killed in one day but the sacrifice payed off. The Americans are victorious, winning the first major battle for the Allies. (Netflix)</p>
