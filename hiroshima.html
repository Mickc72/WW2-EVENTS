					<p><font size="3"><strong>Desperate</strong></font> to end the war in Japan the US is planning an invasion that would dwarf the D'Day landings and the death
					of millions of soldiers would be inevitable. But there was an other way out, the dropping of an an atomic bomb.<br><br>In 1945 the war in the Pacific was raging.
					The Americans were taking over numerous islands and sinking most of the Japanese navy.
					The Japanese people loved their Emperor and the people would fight to the last even by suicide. Kamikaze pilots were used to crash into the
					American ships and demorilise the Americans. Thousands of naval personal were lost with many ships. <br><br>By the capture of one island the American bombers were able
					to attack Japan directly. The Americans start a bombing campaign and on March 10th hundreds of bombers drop thousands on bombs on Tokyo killing 100,000 people.
					In all, the campaign destroys 67 cities. To win the war, the Americans would have to have a full scale invasion of Japan that would dwarf D'Day.
					The President was cautious of such an assault with so many American lives at stake.<br><br> In New Mexico the American president funds the Manhattan project.
					This new weapon could end the war far quicker with the loss of American lives less great.
					The Americans wanted to take the Southern islands but were worried about the fanatical Japanese. Many citizens were trained to fight against any invading force and were
					prepared to die for their country. The Americans thought the Japanese would know where and when they would land, however they still invaded the island of Okinawa.
					During the fight news came that President Roosevelt had died, Harry Truman had now tho take over the roll not knowing of the atomic bomb.
					Many scientists sign a petition to not use a nuclear device and send it onto the President but he never receives it. Truman
					gives the Japanese an ultimatum of the unconditional surrender of Japans armed forces, but this was not an option for Japan.
					<br><br>On August the 6th, three B29 Bombers leave for a target in Japan. On board the Enola Gay is the bomb 'little boy' containing 141 pounds of enriched uranium.
					The target is Hiroshima. On a sunny day At 8:15 am the bomb is dropped, at 8:16 am the city was a hell-scape. In less than a second 70,000 people were killed.
					The temperature was so intense peoples shadows were burnt on the ground. If the Japanese did not now accept the terms more bombs would be dropped.
					However the die hard Japanese military refused to even meet, they thought they had seen worse in Tokyo. On August 9th at 11.01 am the US deployed a second more powerful bomb
					'fatman' over Nagasaki. The Japanese war council open debates and even though greatly divided the Emperor eventually surrenders on the 2nd of September ending WWII. (Netflix)</p>
