					<p><font size="3"><strong>The</strong></font> Battle of the Bulge  is one of the most titanic clashes of WWII.
					As the allies surge west across Europe and looks set to win the war, Hitler had no notion of giving up just yet.
					The Germans lost millions of men in the west and many planes in the east. After D'Day and Stalins victory's the Germans were at a low peak.
					On the 25th August the allies liberate Paris, Brussels and Antwerp followed. The German army retreat with low supplies, but a stubborn Hitler refuses to accept the loss.
					By the 11th of September the allies enter Germany and takes Aachen. Most of Europe was being liberated by the allies.
					<br><br>On advance out of nowhere the Americans are attacked by the 6th SS Panzar army, they are totally surprised.
					The allies had significant losses and were unprepared for the attack. It's ten hours before the attack is known by high command.
					General Bradly thinks there's nothing to the attack but Eisenhower things there is more to it. Overnight the Germans send troop trains and supplies
					to the Western front. While the allies paint their tanks white and obtain white robes to blend in with the landscape the Germans advanced even more.
					The Germans seize more towns including Bastogne and moral runs high as Hitlers plan is working. Running low on ammunition the Americans are surrounded.
					Men went insane from the shelling, hunger and frostbite. However the Americans kept defending this strategic position.
					The Germans give an ultimatum to surrender or the town be flattened, the Americans refuse.<br><br>Then the weather had turned and the heavy fog in the Ardennes clears.
					Now the allies could bomb the German supplies and supply their own troops. Hitlers army were now sitting ducks. Hitler had based the whole offensive on the weather.
					Hitler now summons his generals for meetings, they don't agree what his new offensive is.
					General Patton a fierce American tank commander which drives his men north punching through German lines. He has a huge supply of Sherman tanks which were inferior to the German Tiger and Panzars.
					He breaks into Bastogne the siege is broken by the arrival of his troops. The Germans retreat set fire to the remaining vehicles while the rest run out of fuel.
					Hitlers plan to take Antwerp had failed and the Battle of the Bulge was lost.(Netflix)</p>
