					<p><font size="3"><strong>On</strong></font> the 26th November 1941 the largest ever gathering of naval air power including four aircraft carriers set sail towards a country ten times richer and more powerful then itself.
					Thirty ships carrying over four hundred airplanes and sixteen thousand men set sail across the Pacific. It was a massive gamble with only a fifty chance of success.
					The total element of surprise was key. Of the thousands of Japanese on the island of Hawaii little did the Americans know there was a spy among them collecting intelligence.
					<br><br>The Japanese had meticulously planned the attack for months and even had miniature models of Pearl Harbor on its ships.
					However the signs of an impending attack began to grow as Japanese embassies and consulates were destroying secret code machines and documents.
					This news was sent to Hawaii and other bases around America but Little did the Americans know there was a vast armada heading towards them.
					The US navy fleet were assured they were ready for any impending attack.<br><br>Radar was the new invention in 1941, the army had many mobile units one of which was positioned near Hawaii.
					While the two men were told to practice with it, they found a large cluster of planes on the screen. They reported it and were told it was probably a training exercise.
					The cluster later flew over the manned radar to the Harbour and dropped their bombs unhindered. The planes on the runway had made perfect targets and the armory was locked for fear of saboteurs.
					After bombing all of the planes the Japanese turned to the main price of the US Pacific fleet. Thousands on men perished and nineteen ships destroyed in just two hours.
					The Japanese had succeeded in their mission. This brought the United States into the second world war. (Netflix)</p>
