					<p><font size="3"><strong>The</strong></font> Battle of Britain  was the defense of Great Britain against air raids by the German air force from July
					through September 1940. Hitler never thought about attacking Britain when entering France, he expected Britain would enter into an agreement that would offer them immunity against invasion. However, the Priminister would never agree to this.
					The Battle of France is over the Battle of Britain is just about to begin (Winston Churchill).<br><br>With Germany now acquiring the French navy fleet Churchill could only
					do one thing, that was to bomb it, killing many French navy personal. Hitler was undeterred as he had an air-force twice the size as the British RAF.
					<br><br>The Luftwaffe had crippled the British convoys in the channel and sent bombers across to the UK mainland accompanied by fighter planes. Hitler never believed
					the British could stand up to the might of the Luftwaffe and they never expected the RAF to meet them midway on flight. The British had a massive radar defense system
					called the Dowing System which ran up and down along the coast.<br><br>It also one of the greatest fighter planes of any country during the war...The Spitfire. After many warnings from Hitler to surrender or
					be annihilated the British would not give in. After many attempts by the Germans for many months Hitler could not break the British air defenses and on October 10th 1940 he scrapped the idea of conquering the British by air. Against all odds
					the RAF were victorious (Netflix)</p>.
