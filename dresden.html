					<p><font size="3"><strong>The</strong></font> bombing of Dresden was one of the most controversial events of WWII. It was intended to kill civilians.<br><br>
					Six years earlier the Germans controlled most of Europe. Hitler tells the Luftwaffe not to attack London but by mistake Oxford st. is bombed, in retaliation
					Berlin is bombed by the RAF. Hitler, furious of the planned attacks, sets a bombing campaign on British cities. London was bombed for 50 consecutive days called the Blitz.
					The British had been raiding strategic positions in Germany since 1939 by day but with the technology at the time they could never do this by night and hit their targets.
					With little impact on the German targets many bomber pilots had lost their lives due to German air defenses, moral was low.<br><br> In 1942 a new commander in chief
					is appointed with remit to turn things around. His name was Arthur Harris 'Bomber Harris' hired by the British Government. He spear heads a new strategy of night bombing
					entire German cities without any strategy. This was cold and calculated and thought this would force Germany to surrender by bombing civilians and manufacturing plants.
					In the entire Blitz of London eighteen thousand tonnes of  bombs were dropped, in 1944 a half a million tones were dropped on Germany as the allies ruled the skies.
					July 24th 1943, Hamburg is hit with lethal power, over half the city is destroyed thousands of people are killed.
					The German propaganda machine played down the bombings to the people while the British public were lead to believe the RAF were only targeting strategic sites.
					Many German cities are now smashed by raids.<br><br>Harris is given a target list and to cause chaos and destruction. He wants to show he's right with this campaign.
					February 13th 1945, a stream of Lancaster bombers make their way across the channel into Nazi Germany towards Dresden, a cultural and city of art. The crews didn't come against any German fighters.
					Dresden was never bombed so the public thought this would never happen at this stage of the war so there was no anti aircraft stationed there.
					Over two hundred planes dropped their bombs in just fifteen minutes with hundreds of thousands of clustered incendiaries smashing into the city.
					This combination of bombs was to firestorm the whole city setting it alight, it was completely destroyed. Thousands of people were cooked alive, melting on the streets as there was no escape.
					News of the targeting of civilians was published all over the world by the German propaganda machine. The US blamed the British for the bombings, they didn't wast to be part of it.
					Questions were asked in the British parliament, Churchill distanced himself from the area bombings and the blame of the Dresden attacks focuses on Harris.
					After Dresden the reputation of Harris and bomber command was in tatters. (Netflix)</p>
