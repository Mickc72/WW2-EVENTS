					<p><font size="3"><strong>The</strong></font> war was coming to an end and General Patton was advancing
					through the western front and pushing through Central Wiemar. In 1939 Hitler said if war started it would be the annihilation of the Jews. In 1933 Hitler who was against communism is
					swept into power and bans all other political parties. He places all the undesirables into ghettos and camps. He wanted to start a master race and root out anyone that wasn't Aryan.
					He racially profiled every one in society. The German public turned a blind eye and were persuaded into thinking anyone not Aryan were inferior people. <br><br>Hitler concentrated on the Jews.
					The propaganda wwar machine used the new media of radio and film to send out the message that the German people were suffering because the Jews have too much power. Students burned Jewish books, laws were introduced against marring a Jew.
					Other new laws that were put into action harassed Jews even more, they were forbidden to have pets, radios, cars and were made into second rate humans. The German public did little to
					intervene, some did benefit with taking Jewish jobs when Jews were let go. The Jews thought the harassment would stop but it didn't. Reports by world papers by their treatment were not believed as Germany was falsely accused in WW1 by killing Belgian children
					and babies. Anti semitic was growing across the world. In 1938, 900 Jewish refugees fled to Cuba on a German Transatlantic liner but were turned away so they set sail to the US but were not
					allowed to dock there either. When they returned to Germany they ended up in concentration camps. <br><br> After a German diplomat was killed by a Polish Jew in Paris
					the violence escalated towards the Jewish community. Jews were rounded up and put into Ghettos many died from disease and starvation. In 1941 in a Ukraine valley the Germans murdered 34,000 Jews in just two days.
					People were shot and hung, it was one of the largest massacres of WWII. But some of the German officers were upset by this. So Hitler brought mobile gas trucks for industrialised killing but this was too time consuming. Experiments of the gas chambers began to be used. Hundreds of thousands of Jews were being murdered
					with a new deadly gas. As the Americans are now nearing Buchenwald the prisoners hear this start to they rise up and resist knowing they would be shot by the fleeing German Soldiers.
					On April 7th the starving inmates seize control of the camp and take guns, the Germans fled. When the Americans arrived the gates were open for them to walk straight in.
					The inmates were overjoyed by the American arrival. The barbarities uncovered in the camp were so unbelievable the allied commanders insist in seeing it themselves. Top generals arrived
					and so disgusted General Eisenhower sent for the press. He wanted to show the world. People across Germany were in shock of what happened but how could they have not have known what was going
					on with the trucks and the smell. General Patton forces thousands of locals to tour the camp to witness the horrors within. At the end of the WWII, Six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust.(Netflix)</p>
