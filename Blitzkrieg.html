					<p><font size="3"><strong>Blitzkrieg</strong></font>, the German for "lightning war", was military tactic calculated to create psychological shock and result in
					disorganization in enemy forces through surprise, speed, and superiority in firepower.
					The attacks lead to quick victorys using the Luftwaffe, Panzar tanks and A super human infantry. The German forces swept through
					Poland, Norway, Belgium, Holland and France with astonishing speed and force<br><br>The French which were the most powerful army at the time and
					were far superior thought it would be at least two weeks before the Germans entered their territory, however the Germans entered enemy lines in
					just three days.<br><br>The German soldiers had a secret weapon called 'Pervitin' which was a methamphetamine (know today as crystal meth) that first entered the civilian market in 1938.
					This has greatly helped the German army advance so quick without rest that the French could not believe it. As the Germans approached Paris the French decided to leave the city as they did not want it bombed as they had seen the destruction of Polish cities.
					The hundereds of thousands of troops the British had deployed to France to help their ally against the attack were now being pushed to the coast of Dunkirk.
					British soilders were now stranded on the French coast waiting for naval support to bring them home. They were sitting ducks for the Luftwaffe.
					On the 22nd of June, France surrendered and the Armistice was signed which gave Hitler now total control over France. (Netflix)</p>
